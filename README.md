# Assignment-3
To demonstrate the ability to write basic SQL statements for creating database structures and constraints, processing single and multiple tables, and modifying and deleting data

## Update - 2/26 - 12:04 AM
The file "SQLQueryAssignment3" contains the queries on creating tables and inserting data to those tables. They are also available on Titanium. 
The file "SQL_D-T_Assignment3" is the file where we will write the queries for question D-T. I got started on it but the goal is to finish it by Thursday. Please double check the work.
